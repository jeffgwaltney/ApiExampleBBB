There are 3 required endpoints, but please feel free to add as many more as you want:
/api/applications returns all applications in the Application table.
/api/applications/{id} returns a single application.
/api/applications?category={categoryname}&date={daterange} which filters by category and/or date range. Date range must be inclusive and category should be case insensitive.
Use Dapper to query data.db.
In essence, we're looking for a well architected API and expect that most edge cases are handled well.
